It was the best of times 

Using The Git
1. git init
2. to check the status git status
3. to add file to the git git add chapter1.txt( it will be in the staging area)
4. git commit -m "complete chapter 1"
5. git log (to check the committed file)

6. create 2 files and add them to the staging areas
7 short hand for adding files (git add .)
