It was the best of times 

Using The Git
1. git init
2. to check the status git status
3. to add file to the git git add chapter1.txt( it will be in the staging area)
4. git commit -m "complete chapter 1"
5. git log (to check the committed file)

6. create 2 files and add them to the staging areas
7 short hand for adding files (git add .)
8. git remote add origin

The git Process Revised
1. Createing the file in the directory
2. The file is made to be in a staging area(Git adding)
3.Then commiting the file to git repository
4.Git checkout to check the file
5. checking the differsnces git diff chatpter3.txt
6. git checkout 
7. Git remote add Origin https://github.com/Andre-tech671/story.git
